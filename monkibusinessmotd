I'm shutting down servers.

There is just too many hackers and I can't deal with it right now, I have no real idea why they're doing this. But I have some AntiCheat things that I could use for the next update, the CCU yet again maxxed. I'm starting to think that the hackers just spam it, so sorry this had to happen. I really didn't want to this, but hackers just suck ass and have no purpose in life other than sitting at their desk and do stupid shit. Sorry, the next update will probably release with a better AntiCheat (or not).
