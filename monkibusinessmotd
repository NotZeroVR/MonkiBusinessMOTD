IMPORTANT!

All servers have been shutdown until the next update, so if you can't join a server. That is why, we can't afford CCU. We need at least 200$ in order to afford it, which is what we do not have unfortunately.

Sorry this had to happen, the CCU and Traffic was dying and I didn't want to be kicked off of Photon. The next update should be when we have enough money for servers, until then. Play some other Gorilla Tag Fan Games
