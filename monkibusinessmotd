An apology to all the hackers/modders.

Recently, I was getting very stressed and mad about these hackers/modders attacking Monki Business. Due to my anger issues, it got the best of me and I revealed an IP from a modder/hacker. I deeply apologize to all I have done that too, though you will still continue. Since that is your choice, I deeply apologize. Too anyone that is hacker/modder, please tell Zentrald (i believe that is his name) I am sorry. The other person was just lies, I didn't think it would get out of hand.
